### Choosing secure algorithms and concepts
In principle, the selection should be based on official, trustworthy sources, as these are scientifically founded and kept up to date. In this context, the "National Institute of Standards and Technology" [(NIST)](https://www.nist.gov/) has to be mentioned. It is providing recommendations for all use-cases mentioned here and even more. They make statements about what is currently regarded as the security standard and how cryptographic use-cases can currently be implemented securely. To do this, simply enter the required use case in the search bar of the official NIST page. Particularly helpful here are the search results which refer to a 'recommendation'. These files can also be found quickly and easily by entering the required use case/concept with the addition NIST in the search field of any search engine. 

The "Federal Office for Information Security" [(BSI)](https://www.bsi.bund.de/DE/Home/home_node.html) also offers suitable information, also containing guidelines for the current status of the Information security e.g. [here](https://www.bsi.bund.de/SharedDocs/Downloads/EN/BSI/Publications/TechGuidelines/TG02102/BSI-TR-02102-1.pdf?__blob=publicationFile&v=7).

Especially important is also the choice of the right key length. The length must be observed as it is essential for safety. The possible final lengths are also explained [here](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-57pt1r4.pdf). In principle, the use of longer keys is generally considered to be safer, but with a certain length it must also be balanced between safety and speed. A recommendation to find the right length is also offered by ["BlueKrypt"](https://www.keylength.com/en/compare/). 

Summing up:
- [ ] Research in principle through official sources
- [ ] Before implementing, obtain information from websites such as NIST or obtain from the BSI
- [ ] Especially pay attention to a well chosen key length
